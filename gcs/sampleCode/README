Run both and you will get two windows, move the slider
from the window in button_publisher and click send
and button_subscriber should update its number to
match the publisher

- image_updater.py and key_publisher.py
Run both and you will get two windows one blank and one with an 'x'
key_publisher runs on a keyPressedEvent hander that reacts whenever you
click an arrow key when on the "Event hander" window. Pressing the keys will
cause the 'x' on the other window to move around
